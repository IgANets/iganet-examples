This repository contains example applications for [IGAnets](https://github.com/iganets/iganet), a novel approach to combine the concept of deep operator learning with the mathematical framework of isogeometric analysis.

## Usage instructions

This repository can be used in two modes:

1. As standalone example applications by running CMake on _this_ repository without flags

2. As optional module in [iganets::core](https://github.com/iganets/iganet) by running CMake on the [iganets::core](https://github.com/iganets/iganet) repository with the flag
   ```
   -DIGANET_OPTIONAL="examples"
   ```

3. Compile the code
   ```shell
   make
   ```
